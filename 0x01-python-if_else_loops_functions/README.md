Python Code Examples README
This README provides explanations and expected outputs for a set of Python code examples. Each code example is accompanied by an explanation of its logic and the output it produces.

Contents
If Statements and Conditions

if statements and boolean conditions are demonstrated.
Code shows how to use nested if, elif, and else statements.
For Loops and Ranges

Demonstrates the use of for loops to iterate over ranges of numbers.
Shows how to control the loop iteration and the use of the range function.
Code Examples
1. If Statements and Conditions
Example 1:
python
Copy code
a = 12
if a > 2:
    if a % 2 == 0:
        print("Holberton")
    else:
        print("C is fun")
else:
    print("School")
Expected Output: Holberton

Explanation: This example showcases nested if statements and demonstrates how conditions are evaluated in sequence.

2. For Loops and Ranges
Example 1:
python
Copy code
for i in range(4):
    print(i, end=" ")
Expected Output: 0 1 2 3

Explanation: This example demonstrates the use of a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers and print them.

Feel free to use and modify these code examples for your learning purposes. Each example provides a practical illustration of Python's basic concepts, such as conditional statements and loops.
